# 🧠 Machine Learning Computer Vision Framework (2024–2025)

A Python-based framework designed for **real-time human movement classification** using **custom training data** and **pose estimation**.

## 🚀 Overview

This framework enables developers to classify human movements with minimal setup. Simply upload your labeled training data, and the system will handle pose extraction, model training, and prediction.

Built around **MediaPipe** for pose estimation and a **custom Random Forest Tree Classifier**, the framework supports both **static** and **continuous** motion classification. It includes functionality to merge multiple frames into a feature set — effectively acting as a form of **hyperparameterization**.

## 🛠 Features

- 📸 Real-time pose detection using **MediaPipe**
- 🌲 Custom-built **Random Forest Tree Classifier**
- 🔁 Supports **static** and **sequential motion**
- ⚙️ Customizable frame merging for enhanced accuracy
- 🧩 Easy-to-use: upload data, label positions, and run
- 📈 Demonstrated with high accuracy on **YMCA hand movement classification**
